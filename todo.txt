# MVP
- review existing RBAC and implement
- testing
- Create standard modal format with better UX (esc / click outside to close)

# Less Important
- password reset
- dev tool: view site as x role 
- easily review out_to_sea statuses (or re-think its usage)
- track memberships more precisely (by every renewal instance rather than overwriting expireQtr)
- frontend design
