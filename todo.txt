# MVP
- review existing RBAC and implement
- testing
- lessons page good viewing + editing
  - start populating the calendarDate field in lessons table when creating lesson (old db not doing it)

# Less Important
- password reset
- dev tool: view site as x role 
- easily review out_to_sea statuses (or re-think its usage)
- track memberships more precisely (by every renewal instance rather than overwriting expireQtr)
- frontend design
